# Project-Landing-page
This is my take on the Project Landing Page assignment. I added some info about a new hobby I picked up quite recently to make it feel more personal. Overall, I found the assignment quite challenging and fun. Good use of containers can really make flex-boxes very simple and intuitive to use.
